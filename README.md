### Versions

Since we use JitPack to distribute this library, the versions available 
are the same as the `tags` found on the **releases page** of this repository.

### Shading

If you intend to shade this library, please consider **relocating** the packages
to avoid potential conflicts with other projects. This library also utilizes
nullness annotations, which may be undesirable in a shaded uber-jar. They can
safely be excluded, and you are encouraged to do so.
