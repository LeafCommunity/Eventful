/**
 * Declares the policy for receiving cancelled events.

 * level, and is checked in that order (from most specific to least).
 * Whichever annotation is found first will be the policy used by
 * event listener methods. If no policy is found, then event
 * listener methods will accept cancelled events by default
 * ({@link CancellationPolicy#ACCEPT}).
 * <p>
 * <b>Note: </b> this annotation is only meaningful in conjunction
 * with {@link EventListener}. If your method uses
 * {@link org.bukkit.event.EventHandler},
 * then this annotation's policy will have no effect since Bukkit's
 * standard annotation has its own {@code ignoreCancelled} option.
